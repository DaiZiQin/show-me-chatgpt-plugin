            <h2>Show Me Plugin Description</h2>
            <p>
                The Show Me plugin allows you to create and edit diagrams within ChatGPT in seconds. Visualize ideas, processes, and more as an alternative to reading large blocks of text. We are currently supporting various diagram languages with the most robust support for mermaid graph diagrams.
